# Cebes: the integrated framework for Data Science

## Meet Cebes - your new Data Science buddy

Cebes' mission is to _simplify_ Data Science, hopefully improve the productivity of Data Scientists, help them
to focus on modeling and visualizing, instead of the dreary nitty-gritties.

Cebes does so by:

- Simplifying the interaction with Apache `Spark`

     Cebes provides a client with _pandas_-like APIs for working on big Dataframes,
     so you don't need to connect directly to the Spark cluster to run Spark jobs.
     
- Bringing `Spark` closer to popular Machine Learning libraries like `tensorflow`, `keras`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, etc...

    Besides the rich collections of models in `Spark ML`, any Python Machine Learning library is also supported. 
    Support for R will be considered depending on community's interests.

- Hiding the nitty-gritty of data transferring between different tools

    Your model written in Python will be able to consume data processed by `Spark`,
    without you being involved. Cebes has that covered for you!
    
- Providing unified APIs for processing data and training models

    Machine Learning algorithms can be chained together to form Pipelines,
    which work across libraries. Chain a few preprocessing steps in Spark with 
    a Model training step in `scikit-learn`, then optimize the whole pipeline 
    with Bayesian Optimization. Cebes allows you to do that in a unified API.
    
- Simplifying model deployment and model life-cycle management

    Pipelines can be exported and dockerized, then the Docker image containing
    the necessary services for serving your models can be pushed to a Docker 
    registry of your choice. Cebes can even deploy it to a `Kubernetes` cluster
    if you configure it to do so!
    
    That means you can deploy your newly trained model in literally a few lines of code. 

If that sounds exciting to you, let's check it out by a few examples!

## Why this name, Cebes?

**Cebes** (_c._ 430 â€“ 350 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher from Thebes, remembered as a disciple of Socrates. 
He is one of the speakers in the _Phaedo_ of Plato, in which he is represented as an earnest seeker after 
virtue and truth, keen in argument and cautious in decision.
