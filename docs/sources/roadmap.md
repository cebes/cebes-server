# Roadmap

Here are the features that Cebes is missing, and will be improved, in no particular order. 
Talk to us if you are interested in making some of them (or all of them) happen!

- Pipelines: more Machine Learning and ETL stages, polish the workflow and API.
- Authentication and Authorization for `cebes-server` and `cebes-pipeline-serving`.
- Frontend with user management and for pipeline repository.
- Auto-deployment for `cebes-pipeline-serving`

Some of these are captured in Cebes github issues. Feel free to create new issues for 
features that you care about.
