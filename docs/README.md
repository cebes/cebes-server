# Cebes Documentation

Our documentation uses extended Markdown, as implemented by MkDocs.

## Building the documentation

- install MkDocs and themes: `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-bootswatch`
- `cd` to the `docs/` folder and run:

        $ mkdocs serve # Starts a local webserver: localhost:8000
        $ mkdocs build # Builds a static site in "site" directory
