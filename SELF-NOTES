- Handling exceptions: http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.9/scala/http/routing-dsl/exception-handling.html
- Use gRPC to do REST with JSON: http://www.grpc.io/blog/coreos
  but this requires [gRPC REST Gateway](https://github.com/gengo/grpc-gateway), which is in Go only.
  Apparently we can do similar like this: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/grpc-io/8jhVAttQBC4
  but that is a bit cumbersome.
  So the best way is to wait until grpc-gateway is available in Java/Scala (if that happens at all...)

- Long-term plan:
  - Scala library
  - Pipeline editor (Azure-like)
